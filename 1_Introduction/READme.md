# Snake Game Project:
In this project we use C Programming language. It Has been around Earliest game. which has been around since the earliest days of home computing (1 can remember writing a version of it for my ZX81), and has re-emerged in recent years on mobile phones.

It isn't the world's greatest game, but it does give you an idea of what you can achieve with a relatively simple C program,

and perhaps the basis by which to extend the principles and create more interesting games of your own.

# Playing the game:
You can download the executable to try out the game without having to compile it if you wish.

Download it by clicking here it is about 123k in length Note that on faster PCs, it will be unplayably fast, so you will need to re-compile it with the pause length constant set to a higher value. My PC is about 350MHz and it is OK.To move the snake, use 'a' for up, '2' for down, 'o' for left and 'p' for right.

Again, there are constants you can change if you want to alter these settings. Press 'x' to exit the game at any time.

The aim of the game is to collect the dots (food) and avold the obstacles (crosses, borders, and the snake itself).

As you collect food, the snake gets longer, so increasing your likelihood of crashing into yourself. When you have collected enough food, you progress onto the next level, where your snake gets longer, and the amount of food to collect to progress through the level gets larger. You get scored according to the length of the snake and the number of'x' obstacles on the screen.

The speed increases every 5 levels. You get a bonus when you complete the level of 1000, increasing by 1000 each level. (e.g. complete level 5, you get a 5000 bonus).

There is no concept of lives. Once you hit an obstacle,then game over.
