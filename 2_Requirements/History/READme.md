# History of the game:
The Snake design dates back to the arcade game Blockade, developed and published by Gremlin in 1976.

It was cloned as Bigfoot Bonkers the same year. In 1977, Atari, released two Blockade-inspired titles: the arcade game Dominos and Atari VCS game Surround.

Surround was one of the nine Atari VCS launch titles in the US and was sold by Sears under the name Chase.

That same year, a similar game was launched for the Bally Astrocade as Checkmate.

"Snake II was launched with Nokia’s 3310 in 2000 and it became an entire generation’s obsession"

The snake wasn’t just a line anymore, but had a proper form, there were bonuses and the screen was cyclical, allowing one to go through the bottom of the screen and come back out the top. In India and across the world, kids were hooked, eagerly competing for the highest score whether they were lying in bed, pretending to study in class or sitting at a café. Draining a phone’s battery and earning the wrath of exasperated teachers was just collateral damage.

An addictively simple game, Snake was launched, in its mobile phone avatar, in 1997 with the Nokia 6110 — you remember, the blue candy bar-shaped model with a single antenna
